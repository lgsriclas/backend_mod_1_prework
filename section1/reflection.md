## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  - I was happy to discover that I already use some of the strategies in the SuperLearners Article.  I read a lot, I value the learning process, I have a growth mindset, and for the most part I eat healthy foods (brain power!).  I would like to spend more time teaching others what I know to help me retain what I have learned.  I would also like to incorporate more short breaks into my work time.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

    - puts "Hello World!"

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

    - A pound sign #, which is also known as an octothorpe.

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

    - An integer is a whole number and a float is a number with a decimal point.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

    - animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

    - puts animal

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

    - An interpolation is a feature that allows you to insert data into the middle of a string.

      puts "Have you ever seen an #{animal} without stripes?"


8. What method is used to get input from a user?

    -  variable = gets.chomp

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

    1.  .length - tells how many characters are in a string (including spaces)
    2.  .split - gives your string back as an array
